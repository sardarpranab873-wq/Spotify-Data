# Spotify Dataset Analysis

A.Project Overview:

This project analyzes Spotify’s dataset to understand patterns and relationships in song features such as popularity, danceability, energy, loudness, acousticness, and tempo.
It includes both univariate analysis (examining individual variables) and bivariate analysis (exploring relationships between two variables) to gain deeper insights into how musical attributes affect song performance and listener preferences.

B.The main goals of this project are to:

Explore trends and distributions of key Spotify features.

Identify correlations between numerical and categorical variables.

Visualize patterns that influence popularity and listener engagement.

C.Analysis Performed
1️. Univariate Analysis

Distribution of single features (e.g., popularity, energy, danceability)

Central tendency (mean, median, mode) and spread (standard deviation, range)

Visualization techniques: histograms, boxplots, bar charts, pie charts

2️. Bivariate Analysis

Correlation between numerical variables (e.g., energy vs. loudness, danceability vs. valence)

Relationship between categorical and numerical variables (e.g., genre vs. popularity)

Visualization techniques: scatter plots, heatmaps, pair plots, grouped bar charts
